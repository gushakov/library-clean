## Library DDD example using Clean DDD

## About

This a revisit of a popular implementation of Library domain originally available from 
[ddd-by-examples/library](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples/library). The idea is to implement the same domain but
using Clean DDD approach this time. Having implemented the same domain will allow us to compare and contrast more easily 
two different approaches. Here are the main differences from the original architecture and implementation.

- Clean DDD approach
- Use case centric design
- Less reliance on "Domain Events" pattern

## Copyright notice and disclaimer

The code in this repository is heavily inspired by the original code in 
[ddd-by-examples/library](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples/library) repository. Due to the fact that the same domain
is used by this implementation, some code may appear very similar to the corresponding code in the original repository.
